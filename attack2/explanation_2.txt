This attack is the SQL Injection Attack. It involves a mySQL database.


This is a dude database entry-maker. You put in your name and the coolness algorithm will determine the coolness and write the name and coolness to the dudes table of a database.

in attack/ is the vulnerable node server
in parry/ is the node server that won't allow opener reference

NOTE: mySQL database setup - Either change the connection credentials in index.js or set your server up this way
			   - Also, create a dudes table with VARCHAR(50) 'name' and int 'coolness'

For seeing it in action:

NORMAL USE OF SITE
0. Install dependencies and packages with "npm install"
1. Start Server with "node index.js"
2. Put a/your name into the field and submit it
	- It will submit you into the dudes table
	- Entries will be made like this:

	insert into dudes (name, coolness) values('Enrique',8)

	insert into dudes (name, coolness) values('Danny',3)

	insert into dudes (name, coolness) values('Frederick',5)

3. You will be redirected to the table in the database, where you see your new entry and the coolness number

ATTACK!!!!!!
1. Put in this entry, with the evil idea of putting me in at level 10 coolness: copy from Huynh to Hogarth
         Huynh',10),('Hogarth
2. See after the redirection how the entry slips into the next one, giving Huynh level 10 coolness and subjecting Hogarth to the coolness algorithm.





PREVENTION:

This implements a slash escape of all the special characters like " and '

It is a built in functionality of the query function of the mysql connector package from npm.

You can see how the quotes within the name submission uses \ to neutralize the attack's quotations.
