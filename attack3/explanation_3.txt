This is the click-jacking attack (and prevention)


I downloaded the html webpage for HW5 so that I could host it myself, as I cannot change the settings of the class site to prevent the iframe use (to get points for preventing it).

So, first, I put that in the iframe so that the user thinks they're at the class website.

Then, I put an invisible iframe in front that links to yahoo (no one wants to go to yahoo over google, so that's the evil plan).

If you click anywhere on that hw page, you get redirected.





Prevention:

In the prevention server, I am basically leaning into the idea that I host the hw page (rather than that I host the iframe tomfoolery). This is just so I don't have 2 servers, hacker and website.


So, I install the npm package frameguard. I use it to essentially modify the "X-Frame-Options" to be "DENY". Here is the code snippet:

		const frameguard = require('frameguard')
		app.use(frameguard({ action: 'DENY' }))
